# 📦 Dryfit

**Dryfit** is a research-based software developed to analyze moisture ratio history data from the dehydration of agro-products. It offers tools to fit several thin-layer drying models to M.R history data, evaluates the goodness of fit of each model, moisture diffusivity computation, and visualization amongst many others to support post-harvest technology and food processing research.
