# üì¶ Dryfit

**Dryfit** is a research-based desktop appliciation developed to analyze moisture ratio history data from the dehydration of agro-products. It offers tools to fit several thin-layer drying models to M.R history data, evaluates the goodness of fit of each model, moisture diffusivity computation, and visualization amongst many others to support post-harvest technology and food processing research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

DryFit can be run in two ways:
### üîπ Option 1: Using Python (for developers or researchers with Python installed)
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mazi-kunle/DRYING-SOFTWARE.git
     cd DRYING-SOFTWARE
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
    python app.py
   ```
### üîπ Option 2: Windows Executable Installation (for End Users)

DryFit can be installed like a regular Windows desktop application ‚Äî **no need to install Python or run any scripts**.

#### üßæ Steps:

1. Download the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/dryfit/releases) page  
   (e.g., `DryFit_Setup.exe`).
2. Double-click the downloaded file to run the installer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.
4. After installation:
   - Launch the app from the **Start Menu**
   - Or use the **Desktop shortcut** (if selected during setup)

‚úÖ **Note:** This version is built using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) and includes all required dependencies bundled within the executable.

#### üí° System Requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher (64-bit)
- **Disk Space:** ~100MB (depends on packaging)
- **Permissions:** Administrator access may be required for installation

> This option is recommended for non-technical users or when sharing the app with field researchers and practitioners.

## üìÇ Data Format

**Input data:** DryFit only accepts excel files (`.xlsx`) with the following structure.
  
| Temperature (Celcius)| Thickness (mm)| Time (min) | Moisture Ratio |
|----------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| 60                   | 1.5           | 0          | 1.000          |
|                      |               | 10         | 0.850          |
|                      |               | 20         | 0.700          |
|                      |               | ...        | ...            |

**Requirements:**
  - Each dataset for a particular experiment should be placed in several sheets in one excel file.
  - The excel sheet must contain only 4 columns.
  - The first column must contain only one temperature value in degree Celcius.
  - The second column must contain only one thickness value in mm.
  - The third column can have several time values in minutes.
  - The last column can have several M.R values (Dry Basis).

**Output data:** Results are stored in a folder which includes an excel file containing the calculated data in several sheets and the required plots in `jpeg` format.

## üöÄ Usage

From the GUI:
1. Click the **select...** button to upload your M.R history data file.  
2. Click **Start Analysis**.
3. After some time, a success or error message will be displayed. 
4. View results in the results folder created.  
5. in the case of an error message, click the help button, read the documentation and format the input sheet accordingly.
